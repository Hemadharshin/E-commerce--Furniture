<h1>Frequently Asked Questions.</h1>
<div class="Q1">
    <h4>Is there a minimum rental term?</h4><br>
    <p >The minimum rental term for our Flex scheme is just 3 months.  This gives a fair period of time to trial different workplace settings and <br>
        understand how your people will use the products.  If you combine the trial with occupancy sensors, you will be able to get an accurate <br>picture of usage. If you want to end your subscription earlier than 3 months then you can, but you would still be charged for the full <br>3 months.</p>
</div>
<br><br>

<div class="Q2">
    <h4>What happens after the minimum term term is up?</h4><br>
    <p>After your minimum period is up, you have 3 options:</p><br>
    <p class="par">
        1.If the rental furniture does not suit, you can return it.  All you have to do is let us know and we will collect it from your <br>workplace. <br>
        2.You can continue to rent.  The term will continue as a rolling monthly contract with the option to return with 30 days' notice.<br>
        3.You can purchase the furniture from us.  Simply let us know which items you'd like to buy and we will provide you with the<br>
        purchase cost.This is typically the original purchase cost of the item less 50% of the rental paid.
    </p>
</div>
<br><br>

<div class="Q3">
    <h4>Can we buy the furniture if we decide we want to keep it?</h4><br>
    <p >Absolutely! At any time after the minimum period, you have the option to purchase the furniture.  If you let us know what items you <br>would like to keep, we will then provide a quote for you to buy the furniture items from us.
     </p>
</div>
<br><br>

<div class="Q4">
    <h4>What happens if we move offices during our subscription?</h4><br>
    <p>We can assist you with relocating both the rental furniture and any other furniture into your new offices and can even provide storage <br>facilities for any other items that you need to relocate.  We offer full office design and fit-out services via our sister company so <br>
        we can take care of the entire process for you!</p>
</div>
<br><br>
<div class="Q5">
    <h4>How does payment work ?</h4><br>
    <p>Payment is via monthly Direct Debit.  The delivery and installation charge will be taken separately up front - this depends on the <br>amount of furniture to install and the location of your offices.  The first monthly payment is taken up front and then on the same <br>day of each month.</p>
</div>
<br><br>

<div class="Q6">
    <h4>Who is eligible for FluidSpace Flexâ„¢?</h4><br>
    <p >We provide our FluidSpace Flex service to organisations of all sizes across the UK and Ireland, including landlords, real estate<br> companies, serviced office companies and tenant occupiers.</p>
</div>
<br><br>

<div class="Q7">
    <h4>Is the furniture brand new?</h4><br>
    <p>FluidSpace Flex is a circular service, so if you rent an item of furniture it will not necessarily be brand new. We aim for all <br>furniture to be 'like-new' with only slight signs of usage. Any damaged items are repaired before being sent out on rental so they<br> will always be fit for purpose.</p>
</div>
<br><br>

<div class="Q8">
    <h4>What happens when the furniture cannot be reused?</h4><br>
    <p>We are committed to never throwing away furniture prematurely and we find that most furniture items can have a long lifespan <br>with the right care and refurbishment. In the instance that an item would not be suitable for rental anymore, we sell the item <br>second-hand or make sure it comes to good use with a number of charity partners.</p>
